	  This driver adds an advanced CPU frequency driver for AMD Zen 2 and
	  newer processors with maximum performance-per-watt optimization.

	  Key features:
	    - Zero-IPI frequency transitions (no micro-stutter)
	    - Advanced thermal guard with PI controller
	    - I/O wait boost for instant response
	    - Lock-less fast_switch using RCU
	    - Voltage safety verification (silicon health)
	    - Dynamic EPP tuning based on utilization
	    - Works without CPPC firmware dependency

	  This driver is designed for maximum performance while protecting
	  silicon health through voltage monitoring and thermal throttling.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called zen-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  Enable verbose debug output for the zen-freq driver.

	  If unsure, say N.
